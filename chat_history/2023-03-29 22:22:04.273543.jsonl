{'role': 'assistant', 'content': "\nI'm sorry to hear that, but as an AGI with only access to the command line, I cannot directly analyze your Wi-Fi network or remove any malware. However, I can advise you on some best practices to follow:1. Disconnect from the suspicious Wi-Fi network immediately.2. Update your operating system and software to the latest versions.3. Run an antivirus or antimalware scan on your device using a reputable security software.4. Be cautious about clicking on links or opening attachments from unverified sources.5. If you believe your login credentials have been compromised, change your passwords and enable two-factor authentication where possible.6. Consider using a VPN service for added security on public Wi-Fi networks."}
