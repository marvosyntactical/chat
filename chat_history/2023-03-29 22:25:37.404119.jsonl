{'role': 'assistant', 'content': "\nI'm sorry to hear that, but as an AGI, I can't interact with your Wi-Fi network directly or view any notifications on your local machine. However, I can give you some general advice to handle such situation:1. Disconnect from the suspicious Wi-Fi network immediately.2. Run a malware scan on your computer using a reputable antivirus software. 3. If you find any malware during the scan, let the antivirus software quarantine or remove it.4. Change your important passwords after running the malware scan to ensure your accounts remain secure.5. Check your computer for any operating system updates and install the latest security patches.6. In the future, avoid connecting to untrusted Wi-Fi networks.If you want to check for any particular process running that might be malware, you can use the \nps aux\n command to view running processes and search online for any suspicious ones."}

However, if you provide the list of names, I can try to guide you in determining if any seem suspicious. Be cautious as this method might not be exhaustive or foolproof. It's always good to use a reputable antivirus and keep your system updated to protect against malware."}
