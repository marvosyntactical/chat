After shrinking the Windows partition, you will see unallocated space in the partition layout.7. Locate your Linux partition, right-click on it, and select "Resize/Move."8. Expand the Linux partition by dragging the slider and utilizing the unallocated space. Make sure to leave some free space for the swap partition if you have one.9.
